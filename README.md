# Drawing on the Web - Final Project

My final project gives the viewer a look at a typical day in my quarantined life.
The daily activities displayed are:

1.  Watching Netflix

    Illustration: The page contains a grid of 9 different Netflix shows. One at a time, each image is animated by expanding to fill the screen, then returning to its fixed grid position. Meanwhile, marquees with the token phrase "Are you still watching?" loop over the page in random positions.

2.  Playing with my dog

    Illustration: This page utilizes CSS layering to recreate my backyard with 4 images of my dog in the foreground and a looping video of her running around in background (in-place of the sky). I have added 2 SVG bones to the scene, as well. Each of the dog images have been animated to appear as if they are "dancing" to the embedded audio of "Who Let the Dogs Out?" by Baha Men.

    \*Note: Audio autoplay does NOT work in Chrome

3.  Coloring my adult color books

    Illustration: This page is one large, interactive SVG. When a user clicks a shape, the color assigned to the shape's parent group is revealed, making it appear as if the user is "coloring" the page.

The navigation to access each of these pages consists of three page-related SVG icons, which are animated with color and scale when hovered over, and a color-changing background controlled with Javascript.
