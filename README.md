# Drawing on the Web - Final Project

My final project will bring give the viewer a look at a typical day in my quarantined life.
The daily activities displayed will be:

1.  Watching Netflix

    Illustration: When selected, a Netflix video will fill the screen, before transforming to its designated position in a grid of multiple videos, all of which enter at full screen and then transform to their respective spots. The text "Are you still watching?" will loop infinitly across the screen

2.  Playing with my dog

    Illustration: This page will open on a close-up video of my dog, which will pan out to a video of her running around. This page will have embedded audio of the song, "Who Let the Dogs Out?" by Baha Men. I plan to overlay images and other graphical content to contribute to the scenery.

3.  Coloring my adult color books

    Illustration: The coloring page will display a css drawing made up of various pages from my adult color books. The animation will be dependent on the coloring pages used.

The navigation page to access these pages will consist of three page-related SVG icons, which will be animated with color and scale when hovered over.
